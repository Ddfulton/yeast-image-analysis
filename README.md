### Yeast Image Analysis Preprocessing ###

Process raw data from an Image Analysis GUI into biologically relevant features suitable for data mining and machine learning algorithms.

Features ideally used to identify phenotypes of four budding yeast mutants (SIR2∆, YKU80∆, BRN1-9 and wild-type)  as they undergo mitosis on a dicentric plasmid.

Written for the lab of Dr. Kerry Bloom in June 2016
